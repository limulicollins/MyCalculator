# PyQt Scientific Calculator

- A feature-rich scientific calculator built with **Python 3** and **PyQt5**. It supports basic and advanced math operations, expression history, keyboard input, multiple calculator modes, and angle unit toggling (degrees/radians).

# 🚀 Features

- ✅ Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`)
- ✅ Advanced math: `sqrt`, `log`, `ln`, `exp`, `abs`
- ✅ Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, and their inverses
- ✅ Degrees/Radians toggle for angle inputs
- ✅ Keyboard input support
- ✅ Calculation history panel
- ✅ Multiple modes (basic/scientific)
- ✅ Responsive GUI layout (resizable window)
- ✅ Safe expression evaluation using Python's `ast` module (no `eval`)
